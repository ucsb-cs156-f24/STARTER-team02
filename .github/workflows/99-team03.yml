            the file [`docs/dokku.md`](/ucsb-cs156-f23/STARTER-team03/blob/main/docs/dokku.md) in the repo.  The QA (quality assurance) instance
            starts with the main branch, but later on, you will be able to deploy
            any branch to this instance. You typically do this when you have a PR
            that is being code reviewed.  You can use the your team's Slack channel
            to coordinate who is deploying what to QA at any given time.

                  available in Swagger (following the criteria from team02)

            # Implementation Details:
            - [ ] Find `${{env.name}}.java` in your team02 project in the directory 
                  `src/main/java/edu/ucsb/cs156/example/entities` 
                  and copy it into your team03 project in the same directory.
            - [ ] Do the same for  `${{env.name}}Repository.java` from the directory
                  `src/main/java/edu/ucsb/cs156/example/repositorires`

            Complete the following issues first:
            * Create fixtures for ${{env.name}}
            * Set up GitHub Pages (for Storybook)

            # Acceptance Criteria:

            - [ ] A form called `${{env.name}}Form` is visible in the storybook
                  accessible on the Github Pages link.

            - [ ] The form has all the fields that are in the database table 
                  the form fields are labelled with user-friendly names corresponding
                  to the database table column names.

            - [ ] The form has suitable validations for all fields, indicating which fields
                  are required to be non-blank, and any validation that should be performed
                  (e.g. on dates, time values, numeric values with restricted ranges etc.).
                  You can use regular expressions for this, or any of the other validations
                  features of `react-query-form`, using the `register` feature, documented here:
                  <https://www.react-hook-form.com/api/useform/register/>.  Consult
                  both the `RestaurantForm.js` and `UCSBDatesForm.js` files for examples.

            - [ ] If there are date/time fields, use a date/time picker similar
                  to the one in the `UCSBDatesForm` component.  (If this is
                  not applicable to your table, then you can skip this step.)

            - [ ] The `${{env.name}}Form.stories.js` file should have at least one story 
                  for a create scenario, and another for an update scenario.
                  
            - [ ] The PR description where the code addressing this issue is submitted contains
                  a screenshot of the new form (since this is a frontend change).

            - [ ] The PR description where the code addressing this issue is submitted contains
                  a link to the published storybook for the PR.

            # Implementation Details:

            - [ ] Under `frontend/src/main/components/${{env.name}}/` there is a file
                  called `${{env.name}}Form` modelled after 
                  the files `RestaurantForm.js` and/or `UCSBDatesForm.js`

            - [ ] Change the form fields so that they correspond to 
                  the form fields of your database record.  If there are 
                  are labelled with user-friendly names corresponding
                  to the database table column names.

            - [ ] Add suitable validations for all of your fields indicating which fields
                  are required to be non-blank, and any validation that should be performed
                  (e.g. on dates, time values, numeric values with restricted ranges etc.).
                  You can use regular expressions for this, or any of the other validations
                  features of `react-query-form`, using the `register` feature, documented here:
                  <https://www.react-hook-form.com/api/useform/register/>. 
                  Consult both the `Restaurant` and `UCSBDates` examples for guidance.

            - [ ] The form should take a prop called `initialContents` which is either 
                  undefined, or an object that has the same fields as the database table.
                  When passed, it indicates that the form is being used to edit an existing
                  object.  The `id` field should be displayed as a read-only field,
                  and the other fields are pre-populated with the values from the object.

            - [ ] When the `initialContents` is undefined, it indicates that the form is
                  being used to create a new object.  Therefore, if the id field is autogenerated,
                  it should not be displayed on the form, and other form values should 
                  be either empty, or populated with default or example values (as appropriate).
                  
            - [ ] The form should take prop called `submitAction` which is passed to the
                  `handleSubmit` function returned by `useForm`, as in the examples
                  `RestaurantForm.js` and `UCSBDatesForm.js`

            - [ ] The form should take a prop called `buttonLabel` with a default value
                  of `Create`.  The value of this prop is used as the label for the button
                  as shown in  `RestaurantForm.js` and `UCSBDatesForm.js`.            

            - [ ] Under `frontend/src/test/components/${{env.name}}/` create a file called `${{env.name}}Form.test.js` modelled after the files `RestaurantForm.test.js` and `UCSBDatesForm.test.js`.

            - [ ] Under `frontend/src/stories/components/${{env.name}}/` create a file called `${{env.name}}Form.stories.js` modelled after the files `RestaurantForm.stories.js` and `UCSBDatesForm.stories.js`.
                  
            # Notes

            * For *this* issue, it is not necessary that the form be linked to a
              page that connects it to the backend; that will be done in a later issue.

            * This issue illustrates how it is possible to create at least part of the frontend
              for a feature even if/when the backend is not yet complete.

            * It also illustrates how we can create a component that can be reused, in this
              case for both creating and editing a database record.

            Follow all the usual steps (assign to self, drag to "In Progress", start new branch.)


      - name: Copy Placeholder pages; add to App.js/AppNavbar.js

          body: |

            # Dependencies

            None: can be done in parallel with other issues

            # Discussion

            In this issue, you'll set up placeholders for the three pages you are adding to the app.  
            
            These placeholder components are temporary, but they are necessary so that you can 
            add routes to the pages in `frontend/src/App.js` and add a link to the `/${{env.frontend_url}}` 
            name in to the Navigation Bar of the app in `frontend/src/components/AppNavbar.js`.

            Note that the contents of the placeholder pages and tests are temporary, 
            and will be replaced in a later issue.  However, the changes you make in `App.js`
            and `AppNavbar.js` will be permanent.

            The reason for the placeholder code is that we can't really test the
            changes to `App.js` and `AppNavbar.js` until at least some placeholder 
            component for the pages exists, and we can't really test the new pages unless they 
            are routed to in the app.  The placeholder solves this ["chicken/egg" problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg).
            
            # Acceptance Criteria
            
            - [ ] On the main navigation bar, there is a link to `${{env.name}}`
                  that takes the user to the `${{env.name}}IndexPage` page (a placeholder for now) 
                  at the url `/${{env.frontend_url}}`.
            - [ ] The `${{env.name}}IndexPage` page has a link to the `${{env.name}}CreatePage` page 
                  at the url `/${{env.frontend_url}}/create`.
            - [ ] The `${{env.name}}IndexPage` page has a link to the `${{env.name}}EditPage` page 
                  at the url `/${{env.frontend_url}}/edit/1`.

            # Implementation Steps    
             
            - [ ] Under `frontend/src/main/pages/${{env.name}}/` create three files
                  called `${{env.name}}CreatePage.js`, `${{env.name}}EditPage.js`, `${{env.name}}IndexPage.js`, modelled after 
                  `PlaceholderCreatePage.js`, `PlaceholderEditPage.js`, `PlaceholderIndexPage.js`.
                  The only change that should be needed is the name of the component
                  (see "Notes" below)
                  
            - [ ] Under `frontend/src/tests/pages/${{env.name}}/` create three files called `${{env.name}}CreatePage.test.js`, `${{env.name}}EditPage.test.js`, `${{env.name}}IndexPage.test.js`  modelled after `PlaceholderCreatePage.test.js`, `PlaceholderEditPage.test.js`, `PlaceholderIndexPage.test.js`. The only change that should be needed is the name of the component 
                  being imported.

            - [ ] In `frontend/src/App.js`, there is a section of code that establishes the routes to the pages for the `${{env.name}}` components that looks similar to the ones for `Restaurants`, `UCSBDates`, and the `Placeholder`.  Copy/paste this code, changing, `Restaurant` to  `${{env.name}}`, and `/restaurants` to `/${{env.frontend_url}}` 
                  
            - [ ] In `frontend/src/main/components/Nav/AppNavbar.js`,add a section of code that establishes the navbar link for `${{env.name}}`.  It should look similar to this code that establishes the link for `Restaurants`. Copy/paste this code, changing `/restaurants` to  `/${{env.frontend_url}}`, and `Restaurants` to `${{env.name}}`
                 
            - [ ] Fire up the app on localhost and make sure that you can navigate to the pages for ${{env.name}}.  You should see pages similar to the ones at the `Placeholder` link on the navbar.

            # Notes

            The changes you will need to make from the examples are minimal.

            In the three page components, typically you will only need to change the 
            name of the default export, changing `Placeholder` to `${{env.name}}`

            
            ```js
            export default function PlaceholderCreatePage() {
            ```

            In `App.js`, you will need to:
            * Add import statements for the three page components
            * Copy/paste the section of code below, changing `/restaurants`  to `/${{env.frontend_url}}` and `Restaurant` to `${{env.name}}`
                                 
            ```js
            {
                  hasRole(currentUser, "ROLE_USER") && (
                    <>
                      <Route exact path="/restaurants" element={<RestaurantIndexPage />} />
                    </>
                  )
            }
            {
                  hasRole(currentUser, "ROLE_ADMIN") && (
                    <>
                      <Route exact path="/restaurants/edit/:id" element={<RestaurantEditPage />} />
                      <Route exact path="/restaurants/create" element={<RestaurantCreatePage />} />
                    </>
                  )
            }
            ```

            In `AppNavbar.js`, copy/paste this section of code, and change  `/restaurants` to `/${{env.frontend_url}}` and `Restaurants` to `${{env.name}}`:

            ```js
            {
                  hasRole(currentUser, "ROLE_USER") && (
                    <>
                      <Nav.Link as={NavLink} to="/restaurants">Restaurants</Nav.Link>
                    </>
                  )
            }
            ```

                  and the user remains on the `${{env.frontend_url}}/create` page.

            - [ ] When you submit valid data to the page and click submit, a new valid database
                  entry is stored in the database.  (You can verify this by using the swagger
                  endpoint to view the current data in the table.)

            - [ ] The PR description has step-by-step descriptions for testing the new page, along
                  with screenshots, so that someone reviewing the PR will know what to do to test
                  it, and what it is supposed to look like when it functions correctly.

            # Implementation Details

            - [ ] Before starting, refamiliarize yourself with the backend CRUD API endpoints for 
                  `${{env.name}}` by looking at the swagger page.  You are going to be copy/pasting
                  code from the `Restaurant` and `UCSBDates` components. Those use backend api endpoints
                  that are similar to the ones for `${{env.name}}`, but not identical.  You will need
                  to know the exact name of the API endpoints for `${{env.name}}` in order to
                  be sure that your frontend code is calling the correct backend endpoints.

            - [ ] In `${{env.name}}CreatePage.js`, replace the code from `PlaceholderCreatePage.js` 
                  with code modelled after the files `RestaurantCreatePage.js` and/or `UCSBDatesCreatePage.js`
                  that is appropriate to your `${{env.name}}` table. Be sure to get the API endpoint names correct for your `${{env.name}}` table.

            - [ ] In `${{env.name}}CreatePage.test.js`, replace the code from `PlaceholderCreatePage.test.js` 
                  with code modelled after  the files `RestaurantCreatePage.test.js` and/or `UCSBDatesCreatePage.test.js`
                  appropriate to your `${{env.name}}` table.  Be sure to get the API endpoint names correct for your `${{env.name}}` table.

            - [ ] Under `frontend/src/stories/pages/${{env.name}}/` create a file called `${{env.name}}CreatePage.stories.js` 
                  modelled after the files `RestaurantCreatePage.stories.js` and/or `UCSBDatesCreatePage.stories.js`.

            # Reminders (all from `frontend` directory):
                  
            * To run storybook locally: `npm run storybook`.
            * To run tests locally: `npm test`.
            * Quickly test coverage locally: `npm run coverage`
            * Check linting locally: `npx eslint --fix .`
            * Check mutation coverage locally (slow): `npx stryker run`
            * Check mutation coverage of single file (faster): `npx stryker run -m src/main/pages/${{env.name}}/${{env.name}}CreatePage.js`

            # What to do next

            * Do a PR (following the usual steps).

            Complete the following issues first:
            * Create fixtures for ${{env.name}}
            * Table Component for ${{env.name}} 
            * Copy Placeholders for `${{env.name}}` pages; add to App.js/AppNavbar.js

            # Acceptance Criteria:

            - [ ] When the user navigates to `/${{env.frontend_url}}` the page will be populated
                  with data all rows in the database, and the user will be able to see
                  all of the data in the table.

            - [ ] When the index page is accessed by an admin user, they will be able to
                  see a button to create a new record, and a button to edit each record,
                  and a button to delete each record.

            - [ ] When the index page is accessed by an regular logged in user, 
                  the buttons to create a new record, edit a record, and delete a record
                  will not be visible in the table.  Logged in users will be able to see
                  the data in the table, but that is all.

            - [ ] When the index page is accessed by an admin user, the edit button will
                  navigate to the URL for the edit page for that record.  (The page should display
                  if the issue to implement it is already completed, or a blank page with the correct
                  URL if it is not.)

            - [ ] When the index page is accessed by an admin user, the delete button will
                  call the endpoint to delete the record from the database, and then refresh
                  the page.  The refreshed page will not show the deleted record.

                  a screenshot of the new page (since this is a frontend change).
